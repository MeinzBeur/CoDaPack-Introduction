# CoDaPack-Introduction
Hands on session on CoDA for the NORBIS summer school 2021.

In this hands on session, you will learn some basics of CoDA. As the session is very short, the aim here is not to cover extensively the methods available in CoDA, but rather to have you understand the logic of reasoning with compositional data and ratios. We use an old version of CoDaPack (v.2.02.21) as the new version is currently not available for Linux. [CoDaPack](http://ima.udg.edu/codapack/) is a software suited for beginners as it does not request any knowledge in coding.

## Open CoDaPack
- Open the friday directory on the desktop. Right click inside, and select "Open in the terminal".
- Enter: `java -jar CoDaPack-2.02.21-jar-with-dependencies.jar`

## Preparation of the dataset
The dataset that you will use in this hands on session comes from a paper I published in 2018: </br> [Water Masses and Depth Structure Prokaryotic and T4-Like Viral Communities Around Hydrothermal Systems of the Nordic Seas](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fmicb.2018.01002/full) </br>
At that time, I did not use CoDA to analyse the data, so here is the opportunity to rerun part of the dataset using proper methods!
- Import the csv file by clicking on `File`, `Import`, `csv`. Select `DataSet_WaterMasses_0s_cols.csv`. This is a simplified OTU table with only the 20<sup>th</sup> most abundant OTUs.
